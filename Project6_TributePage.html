        One of his famous saying:

        "If yet your blood does not rage,

        then it is water that flows in your veins.

        For what is the flush of youth,

        if it is not of service to the motherland."

        <h1>Chandrashekhar Azad: Early Life, Family, Education</h1>
        <p>
            He was born on 23 July, 1906 in Bhabra, Madhya Pradesh, and was the son of Pandit Sitaram Tiwari and Jagrani
            Devi. At Bhavra he received his early education and for higher studies, he went to Sanskrit Pathshala,
            Varanasi,Uttar Pradesh. He got involved in revolutionary activities at a very young age. Mahatma Gandhi that
            time launched a Non-Cooperation movement and he joined it. He got his first punishment at an age of 15 years
            when he was caught by the Britishers and sentenced to 15 whiplashes. After this incident, he assumed the
            title of Azad and became famous as Chandrashekhar Azad.
        </p>

        <h3>Chandrashekhar Azad: Revolutionary activities</h3>
        <p>
            Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (1919) deeply disappointed Chandrashekhar Azad. Mahatma Gandhi launched the
            Non-Cooperation movement in 1921 and Chandrashekhar Azad participated actively in it. But due to the
            Chauri-Chaura incident, Gandhi Ji suspended the Non-Cooperation movement in February 1922 that came as a
            blow to the Nationalist Sentiments of Azad. He then decided that a fully aggressive course of action was
            more suitable
            for his desired outcome. He joined a radical association named the Hindustan Republican Association and took
            part in several violent activities including the Kakori train robbery (1925) and killing of a British police
            officer (1928).
        </p>
        <p>
            He was known for his organisational skills and played a key role in reorganising the Hindustan Socialist
            Republican Association. He wanted complete independence for India in any which way. To take avenge on the
            death of Lala Lajpat Rai, he killed the British Assistant Superintendent of Police John Poyantz Saunders.
            His crimes made him a wanted man, but he was able to elude the police for several years. He was constantly
            on move because of Police capturing. On 27 February, 1931, he arranged a meeting with revolutionaries at
            Allahabad's Alfred Park
            (now Chandrashekhar Azad Park). He was betrayed by one of his associates and was besieged by the British
            police.He fought with bravery but seeing no other way to escape, he shot himself and fulfilled his pledge of
            not being caught alive.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was the mentor of Bhagat Singh. To commemorate the bravery of Chandrashekhar Azad, after independence,
            Alfred
            Park in Allahabad was renamed as Chandrashekhar Azad Park. Several patriotic films were also made that
            depicted
            the character of Chandrashekhar Azad like in Rang De Basanti film Amir Khan portrayed the character of
            Chandrashekhar Azad, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            He lived only for 25 years but his role played in India’s independence is not forgettable and inspired
            several
            Indian’s to take part in India’s freedom struggle.
